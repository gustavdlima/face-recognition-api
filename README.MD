This Python API provides facial recognition capabilities using OpenCV and dlib libraries. It allows users to detect faces in images and recognize faces based on pre-trained models.

## Features

- Detect faces in images.
- Recognize known faces based on a pre-trained model.
- Provide bounding box coordinates for detected faces.
- Simple API endpoints for integrating with other applications.
